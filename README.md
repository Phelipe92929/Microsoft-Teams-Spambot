# Microsoft-Teams-Spambot
This is a CLI program that allows you to spam anyone in Microsoft Teams.

I made this bot using the pyautogui, win32api, keyboard, and time modules.

# IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES:
This bot works best on screens that have a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. If your screen is larger than that, then you must move the window to the top-left corner of the screen, and set the window size to 1920x1080 pixels. If your screen is smaller than 1920x1080 pixels, then unfortunately you cannot use this program
